In twilight's gentle, fading glow,
Where dreams in silent whispers flow.
The moon above, a silver stream,
Illuminates each starry beam.

Through night's embrace, the shadows dance,
A fleeting, mystic, moonlit trance.
A canvas painted dark and deep,
Where secret promises we keep.

Beneath the vast celestial dome,
A universe where hearts may roam.
In poetry of night and day,
The echoes of our hopes will stay.
