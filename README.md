In twilight's gentle, fading glow,
Where dreams in silent whispers flow.
The moon above, a silver stream,
Illuminates each starry beam.

Through night's embrace, the shadows dance,
A fleeting, mystic, moonlit trance.
A canvas painted dark and deep,
Where secret promises we keep.

Beneath the vast celestial dome,
A universe where hearts may roam.
In poetry of night and day,
The echoes of our hopes will stay.

Silent night, holy night,
All is calm, all is bright.
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child,
Holy infant so tender and mild.
